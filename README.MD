# Assignment 1 Website

## Description

This website is an online business card project. I had built a few websites before so that was nothing new but I still wanted to challenge myself. To challenge myself, I decided to have multiple continously moving objects using JavaScript. Movement in JavaScript was nothing new to me but doing it in this way was.

The way I started building the website was wrong, I was using HTML and JavaScript loops to build the grid rather than CSS. After learning about creating grids this way (using linear gradients in CSS) I decided to completley rebuild the website. This way better suited my project as the user was not going to interact with the grid and when inspecting the HTML, it was extremely long. Github Copilot assisted me with the creation of the JavaScript and the debugging that followed.
